## Image Overhaul Backlog

This section details images that require replacement due to being placeholders, generic, or contextually mismatched.

---

### 1. Education Page Hero

- **Location:** `EducationPage` Hero Section (`HeroV2` component)
- **Current URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwnOptic/Website-storage/main/AI%20as%20a%20Knowledge%20River.967Z.png`
- **Analysis:** The 'knowledge river' concept is acceptable, but the current image is too abstract and lacks a professional, academic feel suitable for an education page.
- **Hyper Prompt:**
  "**Subject:** A minimalist architectural photograph of a modern university library or lecture hall. Focus on clean lines, natural light, and a sense of structured knowledge.
  **Style:** High-end architectural photography, minimalist, clean aesthetic.
  **Composition:** Symmetrical, one-point perspective shot looking down a row of empty seats or bookshelves.
  **Lighting:** Bright, natural sunlight streaming through large windows, creating soft shadows.
  **Color Palette:** Muted tones, light wood, concrete, with accents of the brand's indigo (`#4f46e5`).
  **Atmosphere:** Scholarly, professional, calm, inspiring, and structured.
  **Technical Details:** Photorealistic, 4K, shot on a Sony A7IV with a wide-angle lens.
  **Negative Prompts:** no people, no books with visible text, no clutter."

### 2. Certificates Page Hero

- **Location:** `CertificatesPage` Hero Section (`HeroV2` component)
- **Current URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwnOptic/Website-storage/main/The%20Seamless%20Integration.657Z.png`
- **Analysis:** This image is completely unrelated to the topic of certificates and professional qualifications. It needs a replacement that visually represents achievement and validation.
- **Hyper Prompt:**
  "**Subject:** An abstract, artistic representation of digital certificates or credentials. Visualize them as glowing, semi-transparent glass plaques with holographic checkmarks, arranged neatly in a row receding into the distance with a shallow depth of field.
  **Style:** 3D render, minimalist, high-tech, professional.
  **Composition:** Low-angle shot looking up at the row of plaques.
  **Lighting:** Soft, internal light from the plaques, with glowing accents in brand indigo and orange, against a dark, clean background.
  **Atmosphere:** Accomplished, professional, validated, secure, modern.
  **Technical Details:** 4K, hyperrealistic render, depth of field, subtle reflections.
  **Negative Prompts:** no text, no paper certificates, no ribbons or medals."

### 3. Tech Stack Page Hero

- **Location:** `TechStackPage` Header Background
- **Current URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwnOptic/Website-storage/main/The%20Digital%20Conductor.881Z.png`
- **Analysis:** The image is generic and doesn't specifically relate to a technology stack. It needs a more fitting visual.
- **Hyper Prompt:**
  "**Subject:** An abstract 3D visualization of interconnected technology logos and code snippets forming a complex, glowing network. Feature logos for React, Power Automate, and Gemini prominently.
  **Style:** Data visualization, 3D render, high-tech.
  **Composition:** A dynamic, orbiting view of the network structure.
  **Lighting:** Volumetric light with glows emanating from the nodes and connections, using brand indigo and orange.
  **Atmosphere:** Complex, interconnected, modern, and powerful.
  **Technical Details:** 4K, depth of field, rendered in Octane.
  **Negative Prompts:** no people, avoid clutter."

### 4. Component Showcase Hero

- **Location:** `ProjectDetailPage` Hero for "Component Showcase"
- **Current URL:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OwnOptic/Website-storage/main/Data%20Point%20Bokeh.png`
- **Analysis:** Too generic. The image should visually represent UI components and web design.
- **Hyper Prompt:**
  "**Subject:** An abstract, deconstructed view of a UI design system. Show floating, semi-transparent cards, buttons, and icons in a clean, organized 3D space.
  **Style:** Minimalist, 3D render, high-end UI/UX aesthetic.
  **Composition:** A dynamic, layered arrangement with a clear sense of depth and organization.
  **Lighting:** Soft, ambient studio lighting.
  **Color Palette:** Use the website's color palette: indigo (`#4f46e5`), orange (`#F26F21`), and grays.
  **Atmosphere:** Organized, clean, professional, and creative.
  **Technical Details:** 4K, hyperrealistic render, shallow depth of field.
  **Negative Prompts:** no text, no code, no people."
