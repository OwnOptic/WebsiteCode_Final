However, this power brings complex ethical challenges. How can insurers leverage AI to assess risk and process claims without perpetuating societal biases? How can they maintain customer trust when decisions are made by 'black box' algorithms? This strategic project was initiated to move beyond the hype and create a practical framework for implementing AI responsibly, ensuring that technological advancement aligns with core ethical principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability.</p>"
