Instead of a manual 20-step checklist, she uses the “AI Onboarding Assistant” in Microsoft Teams.</p><ol><li><b>The Prompt:</b> Sarah starts a chat: “I need to onboard a new employee.”</li><li><b>The Interaction:</b> The agent asks for Mark's CV. After she uploads it, the AI extracts his details, which Sarah quickly confirms. She provides his job title and start date.</li><li><b>The Automation:</b> The moment Sarah confirms the details, the agent initiates the full backend process. Mark receives a professional, branded email with his contract, which he can sign on his phone in seconds, creating an excellent first impression. Once signed, his M365 account is created, IT is ticketed for his equipment, and all relevant departments are notified.</li><li><b>The Resolution:</b> An hour later, Sarah gets a single email confirming the entire process is complete. A task that used to take half a day was finished in a two-minute conversation.</li></ol>"
