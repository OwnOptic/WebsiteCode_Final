The AI's logic is now more stable and reliable, allowing it to better navigate challenges that require planning several moves in advance.</p>"

Avoid it.\n- 'T' is a teleporter to another 'T'.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nGrid:\n#######\n#P..k.#\n#.#d#.#\n#...#E#\n#######\nKeys: 0\n\nAnalyze the state and provide the single best next move to reach the exit.
