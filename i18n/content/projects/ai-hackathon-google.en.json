The assistant provides a simple conversational interface where an agent can ask complex questions in natural language (e.g., 'What is the coverage for water damage in a basement for policy number 12345?') and receive an instant, accurate, and source-cited answer. By leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 Pro model in Vertex AI, our assistant could understand context, query a knowledge base of policy documents, and synthesize clear, reliable answers.</p>"

We started with a design thinking session to deeply understand the user's (the insurance agent's) needs. We then moved quickly to prototype the conversational flow and build the backend on GCP. The process involved setting up a secure knowledge base with sample policy documents and fine-tuning the Gemini model's system prompt to ensure it delivered precise and trustworthy responses, crucial for a regulated industry like insurance.</p>"
