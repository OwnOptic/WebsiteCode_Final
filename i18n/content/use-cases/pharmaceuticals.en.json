They call the pharmaceutical company's hotline, wait on hold, and then spend 15 minutes on the phone with a call center agent who follows a long, rigid script to capture every mandatory piece of information. The agent then manually keys this data into the company's safety database. The process is slow for the HCP and prone to data entry errors by the agent.",

The IT admin manually creates the new notebook from a template, then has to look up the project team list to grant each member the correct permissions. When the project ends, another ticket is needed to archive it, a step that is sometimes forgotten.",
            "value": "When a new research project starts, a new Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) needs to be created with the correct template and permissions. When the project ends, the ELN must be formally archived in a read-only state for long-term data integrity and retrieval. This automation manages the full lifecycle.",
            "roi": "The ROI is measured in compliance and efficiency.\n\n<code>Formula:\nValue = (Admin Hours Saved * Hourly Cost) + (IP Protection Value)</code>\n\nExample: Ensures a consistent, compliant process for ELN management. Saves significant administrative time for both project leads and IT. Guarantees that all completed project data is properly archived, which is critical for long-term intellectual property protection and regulatory compliance.",
            "implementationGuide": "<h5>The Solution Blueprint: Two Lifecycle Flows</h5><p>This solution uses two flows to manage the beginning and end of the ELN lifecycle.</p><h5>Step-by-Step Implementation Guide</h5><ol><li><strong>API Access:</strong> This use case is heavily dependent on your ELN system having a robust set of APIs for creating notebooks and managing user permissions.</li><li><strong>Build the Provisioning Flow:</strong> Trigger from a Microsoft Form. Use HTTP actions to call the ELN system's API to create the notebook and a loop of calls to add users.</li><li><strong>Build the Archiving Flow:</strong> Trigger from your project management system when a project is marked 'Complete.' Use an HTTP action to call the API to change the ELN status to 'Archived.'</li></ol><h5>Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p>Integrate with your chemical or sample inventory system. When a new ELN is provisioned, the flow could also automatically create a corresponding collection or folder in the inventory system, tagged with the same project ID, creating a seamless link between the experimental records and the physical samples.</p>"
