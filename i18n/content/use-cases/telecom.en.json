She calls the customer service line, navigates a complex IVR menu, and waits on hold for 10 minutes, only to ask a question that could be answered by a simple account lookup. The experience is frustrating for Sarah and expensive for the telecom provider.",
            "value": "Telecom contact centers are flooded with high-volume, low-complexity queries about billing, data usage, and plan details. This drives up operational costs and prevents human agents from focusing on high-value interactions like retaining at-risk customers or selling new services.
