Add an Action node to call your Power Automate plugin. Use a Condition node to check the result from the plugin (outage or line_ok). Build out the rest of the conversational path with further Question and Message nodes. Configure the \"Handoff to agent\" at the end of the troubleshooting path.</li></ol><h5>Beyond the Basics (Pro-Tip)</h5><p>Be proactive. Create a scheduled Power Automate flow that runs every hour and queries the network management system for any new area outages. If an outage is detected, the flow can use an AI Builder prompt to generate a clear, human-readable summary of the outage and proactively update the greeting message of the Copilot: \"Welcome to Support. Please be aware we are currently experiencing a service outage in the Geneva area.\"</p>"
