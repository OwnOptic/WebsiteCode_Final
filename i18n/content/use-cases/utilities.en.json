Instead of just reacting to fault codes, collect all the diagnostic data from the meters over time. Use this data to train an AI Builder Prediction model to identify patterns that precede a failure. The flow can then run on all meters daily, and if the model predicts a high probability of failure for a specific meter in the next 30 days, it can proactively schedule a replacement, creating a truly intelligent maintenance system.</p>"
